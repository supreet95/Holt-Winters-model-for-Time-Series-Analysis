PARTICULATE MATTER 2.5 FORECAST

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sought out assistance in investigating the Air Quality at the Millbrook School station 
located in Wake County, North Carolina. Moreover, they would like to specifically focus on the average monthly 
Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5).

After trying out multiple Exponential Smoothing Models (ESMs) to forecast the last six months of air quality, we found the Holt-Winters Multiplicative model to be the best option. Using the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) as our accuracy measure, we found that our forecast model was off by only 20.9%. While other ESMs displayed similar accuracy rates, the Holt-Winters Multiplicative forecast model differentiated itself with its ability to capture seasonality. We specifically selected a multiplicative model after we observed that this model better explained the data, with the least error.
